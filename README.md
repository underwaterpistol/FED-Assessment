# UWP Frontend Technical Assessment

This assessment is an opportunity for us to see how you approach a task and also how you execute it. In short, this task is to consume the response from a GraphQL request to the products endpoint, then generate and display at least 3 product cards from this information. Product cards should contain at a minimum:
* An image
* A title
* A price
* Product tags

Since you have applied for a frontend position, we have supplied the GraphQL request for you and linked it to the fetch button already.

We are evaluating:
* The readability of your code
* How you utilize git 
* How maintainable/conventional your code is
* How closely your submission follows the brief above
* The responsiveness of your solution

We are NOT looking for the fastest/shortest solution. We are not evaluating you on your design ability, however we do still want to see an actual product card. We recommend using VS Code for this assessment. The `Live Sass Compiler` extension will allow you to work in sass in realtime, and the `Live Server` extension will give you a realtime preview of your work.

To get started you should fork off this repo. Once your work is complete, update the main branch on your fork and send it back to us.
